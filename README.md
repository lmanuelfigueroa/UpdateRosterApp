# UpdateRosterApp

This app is a tool created to automate a task from work. The task was to take the list of people's names that attended an event on campus and give points(based on the event) to the people that attended who are part of a rewards program. The app takes two excel sheets the first one is the list of people who attended the event. The second is the roster of people who are part of the program. The app will overwrite the roster of program each time updating the points members receive by cross referencing the event list. 

I created this tool to automate the task of searching names and updating points in our roster one by one by using CTRL+F on excel sheets to find people and updating the points.
